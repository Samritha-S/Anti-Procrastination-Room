# Anti-Procrastination Room 🕯️💻

My first Python project — a small but meaningful step in my journey as a developer.

Anti-Procrastination Room is a simple, gamified study companion built using Python and Tkinter.  
The goal is to make studying feel less overwhelming and help me stay consistent without pressure.

## ✨ Features so far

## 🚧 Work in Progress

I’ll be improving and adding new features **every weekend**, including:
- Visual progress tracking
- Task completion rewards
- Weekly review system
- UI enhancements and personalization

## 🌱 Why this project?
This is my first independent project, and while it’s small, it represents learning, experimentation, and consistency. I’m excited to keep improving it and share my progress publicly as I grow.
